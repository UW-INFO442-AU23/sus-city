## Our Mission
**How might we inform young adult car buyers in King County about carbon emissions from various types of cars to help them minimize the environmental impact of their commutes?**

Our group’s primary focus among the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. This goal emphasizes the importance of creating inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements. Transportation plays an important role in the movement towards a more sustainable world, and for our project, we aim to address the specific challenges of optimizing transportation routes. Sustainable transportation is a major point in achieving this goal, as it directly contributes to reducing carbon emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, and enhancing the overall quality of life in urban environments. Specifically, our project aligns with goal 11.2 of this SDG, emphasizing the need to promote sustainable and accessible transport systems. By addressing the challenges of sustainability of transportation, we aim to make a tangible impact on reducing carbon emissions and fostering a more sustainable and resilient community, aligning our efforts with the broader UN agenda for a sustainable future.
